# Theory:
the purpose of this project is to mimic a cctv over network using websocket protocol with web technologies.
A CCTV  pick up the images, which are then transmitted then to a recording device and then a monitor in this case the webcam well save the images with the help of opencv then saving it to redis and send it via tornado server to a real time show on te browser.

this kind of way called a MJPEG Stream

# Technologies:

<h3>Redis:</h3>

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broke


<h3>OpenCV:</h3>

<h4>OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision and highly optimized .</h4>


 # Resualt:
<h3>Motion MJPEG</h3>
In multimedia, Motion JPEG (M-JPEG or MJPEG) is a video compression format in which each video frame or interlaced field of a digital video sequence is compressed separately as a JPEG image

-----------------------------------------

## For Future Usage:
the "video" is streamd via a html "img" tag â˜º it would be grate if i cant do the same with audio
